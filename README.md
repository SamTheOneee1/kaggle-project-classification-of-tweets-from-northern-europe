## Project Overview

In recent years, social media has become a crucial platform for political discussion. This project leverages NLP and machine learning to classify tweets, focusing on political discourse in Northern Europe. By analyzing these tweets, we aim to uncover trends, sentiments, and patterns in political conversations.

### Objectives

- Classify tweets based on sentiment and topic.
- Use machine learning algorithms to enhance classification accuracy.
- Visualize the results to present insights effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of over 500,000 tweets related to political discourse in Northern Europe. The data is collected from various sources and includes tweets in multiple languages. Each tweet contains metadata such as the user, timestamp, and engagement metrics.

### Data Sources

- Twitter API
- Kaggle Datasets

You can explore the dataset and its features in detail in the `data` directory.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies and libraries to process and analyze the data:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Gensim**: For topic modeling using LDA and NMF.
